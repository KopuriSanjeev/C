History of C.
-------------

1. constants, variables and data types:



constant:  can't be changed.
It is an value which doesn't change.
eg: 10,15,20.5


variable: can be changed
It is a place holder/container of constants. This may vary.


data type: type of variable we are giving. eg int



constant.
10	--> it will not change at all. pocket,wallet, purse etc.

20
50
100

purse/wallet :  contants values.  value in wallet will change.
100
500
3000

data type: 
data type of a variable defines what type of data is going to be stored and how much space is required to store that variable.

int a = 100 ;		integer data.	2 bytes of memory.

int -> data type
a -> variable
100 - > constant.


float b = 22.12;


values should be stored in your computer.

type of box
space for that box

--------------------------------------

operators, operands

eg: arithematic operator, + - * / %

Operators:
Operators are special symbols which perform some operation on operands.

which can perform operations on operands.

Operands:
operands may be variables or constants on which operator performs some operation.

a = b + 10;

+ -> operator.
b , 10 -> operands.

3 types of operators:

1. Unary operator: which requires single operand.
eg: 
a = 10; --> assignment operator

increment or decrement operator.
a++;	// increase value of a by 1.

b--;	// increase value of b by 1.


2. Binary operator: which requires 2 operands.

a = b + c ;

3. Ternary operator: which requires 3 operands.
eg: conditional operator:

? : 

int a = (10==20) ? 20 : 30 ;
